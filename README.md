# NetNewsWire

It’s a free and open source feed reader for macOS.

It’s not in beta yet. Not even alpha! While NetNewsWire 5.0 is feature-complete as of May 25, 2019, it has known bugs — and, surely, plenty of unknown bugs.

It supports [RSS](http://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html), [Atom](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287), [JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org/), and [RSS-in-JSON](https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/blob/master/rss-in-json/README.md) formats.

Also see the [Technotes](Technotes/) and the [Roadmap](Technotes/Roadmap.md).

Note: NetNewsWire’s Help menu has a bunch of these links, so you don’t have to remember to come back to this page.

#### Community

[Join the Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/netnewswire/shared_invite/enQtNjM4MDA1MjQzMDkzLTNlNjBhOWVhYzdhYjA4ZWFhMzQ1MTUxYjU0NTE5ZGY0YzYwZWJhNjYwNTNmNTg2NjIwYWY4YzhlYzk5NmU3ZTc) to talk with other NetNewsWire users — and to help out, if you’d like to, by testing, coding, writing, providing feedback, or just helping us think things through. Everybody is welcome and encouraged to join.

#### On accepting pull requests

It’s pretty early still, and we have strong opinions about how we want to do things, so we’re not seeking help just yet.

That said, we will seriously consider any pull requests we do get. Just note that we may not accept them, or we may accept them and do a bunch of revision.

It’s probably a good idea to let us know first what you’d like to do. The best place for that is definitely the [Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/netnewswire/shared_invite/enQtNjM4MDA1MjQzMDkzLTNlNjBhOWVhYzdhYjA4ZWFhMzQ1MTUxYjU0NTE5ZGY0YzYwZWJhNjYwNTNmNTg2NjIwYWY4YzhlYzk5NmU3ZTc).

We do plan to add more and more contributors over time. Totally. But we’re taking it slow as we learn how to manage an open source project.
